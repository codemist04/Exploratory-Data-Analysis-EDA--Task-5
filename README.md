# 🚢 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project focuses on performing a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover insights and patterns related to passenger survival.

## 📌 Description
The dataset was explored to understand its structure, identify missing values, and analyze categorical and numerical features. Visualizations such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, count plots, pair plots, and heatmaps were created to study feature distributions and relationships. Detailed observations were documented for each plot, and a final summary of findings was compiled.

## 💻 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Google Colab

## 📁 Files Included
- **[Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)** – Titanic dataset source  
- `Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Task 5.ipynb` – Colab notebook containing full EDA code  
- **Summary of Findings(EDA).pdf** – Detailed EDA report with observations  

## ✅ Steps Performed
- Loaded and explored dataset structure  
- Analyzed and handled missing values  
- Studied categorical and numerical feature distributions  
- Created and interpreted multiple visualizations  
- Compiled a summary of findings

## 📊 Future Work
